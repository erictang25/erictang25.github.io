  <p>
    I am a final year Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) PhD candidate at Carnegie Mellon University in the 
    <a href="http://www.spiral.net" target="_blank">SPIRAL</a> research group co-advised by 
    <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~franzf/" target="_blank">Franz Franchetti</a> and 
    <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/doku/doku.php?id=home" target="_blank">James Hoe</a>. My research interests
    broadly lie in computer architecture and high performance computation. I am particularly interested in programming
    models for heterogeneous systems and Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures.
  </p>
  <p>
    I graduated from Cornell University in May 2020 with a major in ECE and a minor in computer science. At Cornell I 
    worked with <a href="https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~cbatten/" target="_blank">Christopher Batten</a> 
    in the Batten Research Group (BRG). During this time, I worked on bringing up testing infrastructure for ASICs 
    that had been taped out and building a 
    <a href="https://github.com/cornell-brg/pymtl3-mem" target="_blank">cache generator</a>.
